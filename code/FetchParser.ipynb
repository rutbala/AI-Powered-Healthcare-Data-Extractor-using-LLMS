I have seen Mr Tan \\nregularly since then, on average once or twice a year. For purposes of this medical report, I re-\\nexamined Mr Tan on 20 June 2015. \\nSECTION 3: PATIENT’S MEDICAL INFORMATION \\nPatient’s clinical history: \\nPlease also state the source of the information (e.g. from medical records, from the patient, \\nfrom the applicant etc.). \\nMr Tan Ah Kow was accompanied by his son, Mr Tan Ah Beng, for the examination. Mr Tan is a 55 \\nyear old man, who is divorced, and unemployed. Mr Tan is currently living with his son, Ah Beng, \\nin Ah Beng’s flat. Mr Tan Ah Beng informed me that Mr Tan Ah Kow used to work as a cleaner. \\nMr Tan Ah Kow has a history of medical conditions. He has had hypertension and hyperlipidemia \\nsince 1990 and suffered several strokes in 2005. He subsequently developed heart problems \\n(cardiomyopathy), cardiac failure and chronic renal disease and was treated in ABC Hospital. \\nHe was last admitted to the ABC Hospital on 1 April 2010 till 15 April 2010, during which he was \\ndiagnosed to have suffered from a stroke. This was confirmed by CT and MRI brain scans. \\nThereafter, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for stroke rehabilitation on 15 April 2010. \\nAfter that, Mr Tan was referred to Blackacre Hospital for follow-up treatment from in November \\n2010. The clinical impression was that he was manifesting behavioural and psychological \\nsymptoms secondary to Dementia. \\n- 3 - '), Document(metadata={'source': 'SampleMR.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='The clinical impression was that he was manifesting behavioural and psychological symptoms \\nsecondary to Dementia. \\nI was informed by Mr Tan Ah Beng that Mr Tan is at present incontinent, and is unable to bathe or \\nuse the toilet on his own. He is, however, able to feed himself. \\nI have observed a gradual deterioration in his cognitive ability and physical state over the years. \\nFindings from physical examination / mental state examination: \\nPlease state your observations of the patient (i.e. the patient’s demeanour, body language, tone \\nof voice etc. relevant to your assessment), the interactions you had with the patient/the tests \\nyou administered/the questions you posed, and the date you examined the patient. \\nMr Tan was brought to the clinic in a wheel chair. His mood was euthymic (i.e. normal, non-\\ndepressed and reasonably positive mood) and he did not have any psychotic symptoms. \\nOrientation to time, place and person \\nWith regard to his orientation to time, place and person, he was unable to tell that he was in a \\nhospital clinic but identified his son and was able to tell his own name and the name of his son. \\nAfter being told he was in a hospital clinic, he identified me as a doctor, when asked. However, \\nhe could not remember my name, although I have been treating him for the last 5 years. He was \\nable to tell correctly how he arrived at the clinic. However, when asked some moments later \\nwhere he was, he said he did not know. \\nHe said that it was 10 February (actual date 20 June) and it was a Wednesday (actual day, \\nMonday). He appeared to be just guessing as to what date and day it was. After being told what \\nthe day and date were, he forgot a few moments later after being asked again. He could not \\nanswer when asked what year it was. \\nWhen asked what time it was, he said that it was 5pm in the afternoon (actual time, 3pm). He \\nwas not able to tell the time from looking at a watch. \\nBasic information \\nHe gave his age as 50 years old (actually 55 years) and could not answer when asked when his \\nbirthday was. He correctly said he lived in a flat with his son, but could not give the correct \\naddress, and also got the area wrong (he said the flat was in Bedok, when it was actually in \\nJurong.) He incorrectly stated that the Prime Minister was Lee Kuan Yew. \\n- 4 - \\nSimple arithmetic, financial issues \\nMr Tan was unable to perform simple arithmetic such as 4 plus 3, giving 8 as the answer, and \\ncould not subtract 7 from 10. He could not count backwards from 20 to 1. \\nHe was unable to recognise notes or coins (he identified a 50-cent coin as 20 cents and a 10-\\ndollar note as 2 dollars). \\nPersonal welfare/property and affairs related questions \\nI asked Mr Tan if he owned any property. Mr Tan said he did. I asked him if he was the sole owner. \\nHe said yes. (However, Mr Tan Ah Beng informed me that Mr Tan owned the flat together with his '), Document(metadata={'source': 'SampleMR.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='(Mr Tan’s) elderly mother, in joint names, and that the elderly mother was currently living in the \\nflat by herself.) I asked Mr Tan what the address of the flat was. He said he could not remember. I \\nasked how many rooms the flat had, and he said it was a 4-room flat. (However, Mr Tan Ah Beng \\nsaid it was a 3-room flat.) I asked Mr Tan what he wanted to do with the flat, since he was not \\nstaying there. He said that he wanted to rent it out. I asked him whether he planned to rent out \\nthe whole flat. Mr Tan said yes (even though his elderly mother was still living there.) I asked him \\nhow much rent he planned to charge, Mr Tan said he did not know, and that he was not good at \\nmoney matters. \\nI asked him whether he knew what medical problems he had. Mr Tan just stared at me blankly \\nand shook his head. I asked him whether he remembered being in hospital before. Mr Tan \\nnodded. I asked him if he knew what he was in hospital for. Mr Tan shook his head. I asked him if \\nhe was taking any medicine at the moment. Mr Tan just looked at me blankly and did not reply. \\nDate of physical examination/mental state examination: 20 June 2015 \\nRelevant investigation results: \\n[Results of CT brain, MRI brain scan and other investigations to be stated.] \\n- 5 - \\nDiagnosis: \\n1.

'), Document(metadata={'source': 'SampleMR.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=' Yes \\n  No \\nOPINION ON PATIENT’S MENTAL CAPACITY IN RELATION TO PROPERTY AND AFFAIRS \\nIn your opinion, can the patient understand information relevant to a decision relating to his or \\nher property and affairs? \\n Yes \\n  No \\nIn your opinion, can the patient retain information long enough to make a decision relating to his \\nor her property and affairs? \\n Yes \\n  No \\nIn your opinion, can the patient weigh information as part of the process of making a decision \\nrelating to his or her property and affairs? \\n Yes \\n  No \\nIn your opinion, can the patient communicate his or her decision relating to his or her property \\nand affairs? \\nYes \\n No \\nTaking into consideration the above, in your opinion, does the patient have mental capacity in \\nrespect of property and affairs? \\n Yes \\n No \\n- 7 - \\nPlease state the basis of your opinion above in respect of the patient’s mental capacity: \\nMr Tan’s dementia and stroke have impaired the functioning of his mind and brain. His failure to \\nremember where he was (i.e. in the hospital) and the day and date, despite being told a short \\nwhile ago, shows his inability to retain information. He was also not able to remember basic \\ninformation such as his age, and the address where he lives. \\nHis failure to tell the time from a watch or to recognize notes and coins shows his inability to \\nunderstand simple information. \\nHe could not do basic arithmetic, which shows that he is not able to weigh and use information. \\nSince he is unable to understand, retain, use or weigh simple information, due to his memory \\ndeficits and cognitive failures, he will not be able to make decisions about his personal and \\nfinancial affairs, which would require being able to process such information. This is also \\ndemonstrated by his inability to remember basic information on the property he owns with his \\nelderly mother, and also his inability to make a realistic and concrete plan for what to do with \\nthe property. He was also not able to remember what medical problems he has, and not able to \\nanswer a question as to whether he is currently on medication. \\nIn my view, his cognitive functions are unlikely to improve and would most likely get worse over \\ntime, as there is no treatment which can reverse his dementia.
